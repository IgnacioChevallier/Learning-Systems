# Learning Automata Game - Assignment 1

## Instructions
Implement the following program and justify your results: 
1. Create 5 Tsetlin Automata with actions “No” and “Yes” 
2. Count the number of Tsetlin Automata that outputs a “Yes”-action 
3. If the number of “Yes”-actions is M Then: 
    - If M = 0 OR 1 OR 2 OR 3: Give each Automaton a reward with probability M ∗ 0.2, otherwise a penalty
    - If M = 4 OR 5: Give each Automaton a reward with probability 0.6 − (M − 3) ∗ 0.2, otherwise a penalty 
4. Goto 2

**Remark:** Generate the rewards independently for each automaton
