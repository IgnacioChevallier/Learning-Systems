# Learning Systems

## Overview

Learning Systems represents an alternative approach to modern AI that addresses the three critical issues of contemporary machine learning: **Energy**, **Transparency**, and **Power**.

### The Three Betrayals of Modern AI

1. **Energy Consumption**: Models like ChatGPT consume extreme amounts of energy - one query is approximately equivalent to 20 minutes of turning on a lightbulb.

2. **Transparency**: Deep learning models are extremely difficult to understand due to their complexity.

3. **Power Concentration**: These techniques give big companies immense power over society, leading to algorithmic manipulation and biased systems that claim objectivity.

### The Norwegian Alternative: Tsetlin Automata

**The Tsetlin Machine** combines thousands of simple "rat brain" machines with propositional logic:

**Key Principle**: *The model is the explanation && The explanation is the model*

#### Characteristics

- **Transparency**: The system tells you when it doesn't know and shows the data foundation for its decisions
- **Energy Efficiency**: Much lower energy consumption compared to neural networks
- **Interpretability**: Based on propositional logic, making decisions explainable
